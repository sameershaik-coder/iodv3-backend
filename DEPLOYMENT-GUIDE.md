# IOD V3 Backend - Deployment & Cleanup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start Summary

You now have a **complete ingress-based deployment system** with comprehensive cleanup capabilities.

### ✅ What Was Implemented

1. **Ingress Migration**: All services converted from NodePort to ingress-based access
2. **Hybrid Deployment**: Support for both ingress and NodePort access methods
3. **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Complete resource management and cleanup system
4. **Status Monitoring**: Real-time deployment status verification

---

## 🌐 Ingress Access (Production-Ready)

### Deploy with Ingress
```bash
make deploy-ingress    # Ingress-only deployment
make deploy-hybrid     # Both ingress + NodePort access
```

### Access URLs
- **Main App**: http://dev.iodv3.local/
- **Accounts Service**: http://dev.iodv3.local/accounts/
- **Blog Service**: http://dev.iodv3.local/blog/

### Test Ingress
```bash
make test-ingress      # Test all ingress endpoints
```

---

## 🧹 Cleanup System

### Complete Cleanup (Everything)
```bash
make cleanup           # Removes ALL resources
make clean-all         # Same as above
```

### Selective Cleanup
```bash
make cleanup-kind      # Kind clusters only (nodes + ingress + all resources)
make cleanup-docker    # Docker images/containers only
make cleanup-hosts     # Host entries only
make clean-selective   # Interactive cleanup menu
```

### What Gets Deleted

**`make cleanup-kind` removes:**
- ✅ All cluster nodes (control-plane + workers)
- ✅ All Kubernetes resources (pods, services, ingresses)
- ✅ All persistent volumes and claims
- ✅ Ingress controller and admission webhooks
- ✅ All network configurations
- ✅ All cluster-wide resources (RBAC, CRDs, etc.)

**`make cleanup` (complete) removes:**
- ✅ Everything above PLUS
- ✅ All Docker images and containers
- ✅ Docker registry
- ✅ Host entries (/etc/hosts)
- ✅ Temporary files and logs

---

## 📊 Status & Verification

### Check Current Status
```bash
make status            # Show what's currently deployed
make deployment-status # Detailed deployment information
```

### Verify Cleanup
```bash
make verify-cleanup    # Check if cleanup was successful
```

---

## 🔄 Full Lifecycle Example

```bash
# 1. Deploy with hybrid access (ingress + NodePort)
make deploy-hybrid

# 2. Check status
make status

# 3. Test everything works
make test-ingress
make test-nodeport

# 4. When done, complete cleanup
make cleanup

# 5. Verify cleanup worked
make verify-cleanup
```

## 🎯 Answer to Your Questions

### ✅ "Update all deployment files to use ingress based access"
**COMPLETED**: All services converted to ClusterIP and ingress routing implemented

### ✅ "Check if there is cleanup script for deployment"
**CREATED**: Comprehensive cleanup system with multiple options

### ✅ "Did you add steps to delete the cluster, nodes, ingress etc"
**YES**: Complete cleanup includes:
